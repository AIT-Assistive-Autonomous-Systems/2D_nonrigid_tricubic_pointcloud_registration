# 2D non-rigid point cloud registration

## Introduction

This repository contains a prototype implementation of a 2D non-rigid point cloud registration algorithm.

## Requirements

The prototype has been tested with Matlab R2023a. It requires the "Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox".

## Usage

The prototype can simply be run by executing in Matlab:

```matlab
cd test
run_nonrigidRegistrationGUI.m
